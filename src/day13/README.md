## Post-Task Thoughts

Man that was a lot of fun. I had been getting sick of numeric results for every problem, what an awesome way to switch it up.
I felt like Sherlock Holmes uncovering the text at the end of part 2. It's a battle between this and day 11 for my favourite tasks so far.

Not overly difficult, again a problem that is made a heck of a lot easier with numpy functions like flip.
Advent of code were particularly kind on this one ensuring the page was always being folded in half.
I assumed they wouldn't do this and built a system to pad the smaller half with zeros in-case, however I realised I could remove this at the end.
