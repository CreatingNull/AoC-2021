## Post-Task Thoughts

It was nice to have a bit of an easier one after day 8.
Unfortunately I didn't read the second part of the question correctly, and was making out the problem to be more difficult than it was.

I ended up using recursion to explore the area around the low points, but any method to locate the cavities within the '9' digits would've done the trick.
