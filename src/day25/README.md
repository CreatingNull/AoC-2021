## Post-Task Thoughts

Thank goodness, a fun easy task for the final day.
There was only one part in the final task, which was a nice surprise after the slog that was day 24.

Numpy is the real MVP of this year's advent of code.
Good old batch operations for shifting array columns and setting values made this task super easy.
The cost is a bit of additional memory consumption but nothing any PC from the last 30 years can't handle.
I originally solved with an iterative solution but this was very slow and in general if you are iterating on a numpy array you are using numpy incorrectly.

Lots of fun, I've learnt so much over the last month.
I don't think I fully comprehended the time investment of this challenge, but I am glad I persevered and finished the whole thing.
