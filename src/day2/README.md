## Post-Task Thoughts

Not much to say on this one, pretty straight forward.
A little disappointed that the second part of the challenge introduced changed to the `aimed` movement, which is just a completely different movement mechanic.
I prefer when the transitions are more symbiotic between part 1 and part 2.

Also noting my tendency to start solving these problems with a class, and then after realising the full scope of the problem I am able to simplify the solution.
