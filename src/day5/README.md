## Post-Task Thoughts

Fun task, basically computation of Cartesian points.
Because we are iterating through multiple vents trying to look for matching points, storing points in a dictionary makes a lot of sense as you can utilise the efficiency of hashed lookups.

It was easy to design for this task as it was clear in part 1 what the scope of the second part was going to be (diagonal lines), so I think everyone was able to prepare themselves for handling this case.
