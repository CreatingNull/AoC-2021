## Post-Task Thoughts

Yuck! I really struggled with this one. It was a very wordy problem, so it took me a while to fully understand how the input data actually tied in the question.
I am really not happy with my solution, I just ran out free time before the next task was released.

Really well-designed problem nonetheless, I compare it to solving a sudoku, and it was a lot of fun working through it on paper.
Not so much fun when I tried to implement it without fully comprehending what I was trying to do, but we got a working solution.
