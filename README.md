Just having a stab at the [2021 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenge.
These are **not** ideal or reference solutions by any stretch of the imagination.

## Personal Rules

It's easy to get carried away on this challenge, but for me this year as I am working around a full-time job and a mountain of other hobbies:

1. This is about having fun, challenging myself and learning new things.
2. I may skip days, particularly if I am getting bogged down on the problem or life gets in the way (See Rule #1).
3. This year I am open to using 3rd party non-core python libraries where they would reduce dev time on a problem.
4. I will not look at any reference solutions unless I have solved the problem already.
5. I can research ways of efficiently solving general problems required by the task provided it doesn't conflict with Rule #4.
