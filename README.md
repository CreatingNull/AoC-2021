Just having a stab at the [2021 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenge.
These are **not** ideal or reference solutions by any stretch of the imagination.

## Personal Rules

It's easy to get carried away on this challenge, but I have a full time job and a mountain of other hobbies, so...

1. This is about having fun, challenging myself and learning new things.
2. I may skip days, particularly if I am getting bogged down on the problem or life gets in the way (See Rule #1).
3. This year I am open to using 3rd party non-core python libraries where they would reduce dev time on a problem.
4. I will not look at any reference solutions unless I have solved the problem already.
5. I can research ways of efficiently solving general problems required by the task provided it doesn't conflict with Rule #4.

## Structure

Every day has its own package in the [src](src), this is used to define any unique code or functions for solving the daily problems.
My personal data is included as a text file in each challenge's package under the `data` subdir, this is so anyone could verify my results without needing my AoC auth token.

The days code is executed using a module in the [tests](src/tests) package that executes via a Pytest runner.
This pytest modules verify the answers against those I computed in the challenge, you can see the result of all the automated tests in [Github Actions](https://github.com/CreatingNull/AoC-2021/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml).

Code formatting is handled via [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) see the [hooks](.pre-commit-config.yaml) used on this repo.
